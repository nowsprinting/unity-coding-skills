Guide for writing code in Unity projects.

## Rules

- Before modifying any code file, check if the editor is in Play Mode. If it is, stop it using the `mcp__jetbrains__unity_play_control` tool first — Play Mode may skip recompilation, leaving stale code active.
- Never create `.meta` files. Unity editor creates them automatically.
- When editing (creating or modifying) scene (`.unity`) or prefab (`.prefab`) files, use the `edit-scene` skill.
- When instantiating a prefab multiple times, give each instance a unique `GameObject.name`; otherwise, automated tests cannot identify a specific instance. Use a concrete name (e.g., `"<PrefabName>(Hero)"`) or append an index (e.g., `"<PrefabName>(0)"`).

## Resources

Read the appropriate resource file based on the situation:

- Before writing or modifying any code file: Read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/resources/coding-guideline.md`
- Before writing or modifying any code file: Read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/resources/unity-modern-guidelines.md`
- Before writing or modifying MonoBehaviour lifecycle or event-handling methods (Awake, Start, OnEnable, OnDisable, OnDestroy, Update, FixedUpdate, LateUpdate, OnCollision*, OnTrigger*, OnGUI, OnMouse*, OnBecame*, OnPreCull, OnPreRender, OnPostRender, OnRenderImage, OnRenderObject, OnWillRenderObject, OnAnimatorMove, OnAnimatorIK, OnDrawGizmos): Read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/resources/unity-event-functions.md`
- Before referencing an API, verifying a package behavior, or looking up documentation: Read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/resources/unity-references.md`
- When resolving diagnostics or handling code review feedback: Read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/resources/diagnostics-review-feedback.md`
